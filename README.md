# Python_Challenge
Python_Challenge_3


I have created a new repository for this project called `python-challenge`. 
I cloned this repository onto my local git and using my terminal I created 2 folders "PyBank" and "PyPoll". 
Then I commited and pushed this to GitHub.

Inside of each folder "PyBank" and "PyPoll" I added the following:

A new file called `main.py`. This contains the main script to run for each analysis.
A `Resources` folder that contains the CSV files used.
An `analysis` folder that contains your text file that has the results from my analysis.

I commited and pushed these to GitHub.


In the analysis of PyBank, we see the total number of months in the dataset is 85 months with a $22564197 profit in that duration of time. The average of Profit/Loss in the whole dataset is -8311.11.
August 2016 was the month and year with the greatest profit increase resulting in: $1862002 profit increase. 
February 2014 was the toughest month and year resulting in $1825558 loss. 

Analysing PyPoll, we see here that 369711 votes were cast devided in the following way for these 3 candidates: 
Diana DeGette              272892
Charles Casper Stockham     85213
Raymon Anthony Doane        11606

Diane DeGette was the clear winner casting 73.81% of all the votes whole Charles and Raymon got 23% and 3% respectively.
